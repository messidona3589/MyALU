# MyALU

1. Implement an ALU chip (MyALU), of your own design, that computes 19 functions (the 18 functions from original ALU, in addition to the X xor Y).

2. Output, as per the required order (in ALU + xor) and the 5 control bits (C4, C3, C2, C1, C0) with values in binary form (you are required to complete them according to the Decimal values left column). 

For example, the first row : C4=0, C3=0, C2=0, C1=0, C0 = 0 then output = 0 / the third row : C4=0, C3=0, C2=0, C1=1, C0=1 then output = x...
